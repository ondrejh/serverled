Arduino FM transmitter program:

I could be used to controll arduino FM transmitter HW.
It can power ON/OFF device, reads its status (from display) and tune frequency.

Examples of use:
    Power ON device:
        radio ON
    Power OFF device:
        radio OFF
    Tune frequency (103.0MHz for example):
        radio TUNE103.0
    Get status:
        radio

Aditional flags:
    -p /dev/ttyUSB1 ... changes communication port
